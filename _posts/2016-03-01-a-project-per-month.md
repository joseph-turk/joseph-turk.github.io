title: A Project Per Month

I have a hard time finishing side projects. I start something, try learning a new tool, and then drop it before I ever finish a project. Here's how I'm going to stop that.

Deadlines tend to be great motivators for me. I work on writing and editing proposals as part of my day job, and I tend to become more and more productive as we get closer to the submission deadline. So starting in March, I’m going to make a point of completing one side project every month for the rest of the year. I’m going to go from project initiation to Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in a month or less.

Here’s my basic plan.

## Week 1: Planning
- Pick a project from my backlog of ideas.
- Define baseline requirements.
- Rough out the design.
- Decide on a technology stack.

## Week 2-3: Development
- Build the damn thing. (And don't move on to a new project if I hit a roadblock.)
- Write automated tests as I go.

## Week 4: Testing and Deployment
- Do further functional testing in the browser.
- Decide on domain and hosting.
- Set up deployment procedures.
- Deploy to production.
- Write a blog post about things I learned.

Simple enough, right?
