title: A Project Per Month
layout: post

I have a hard time finishing side projects. I start something, try learning a new tool, and then drop it before I have something complete and ready to show. I need to stop that.

So starting in March, I’m going to release one side project every month for the rest of the year. I’m going to go from project initiation to MVP release in a month or less.

Here’s my plan.

## Week 1: Planning
- Decide on a technology stack.
- Rough out the design.
- Define baseline requirements.

## Week 2-3: Development
- Build the damn thing.

## Week 4: Testing and Deployment
- Do some basic testing in my local environment.
- Set up deployment procedures.
- Deploy to production.
- Write a blog post about things I learned.

I have two goals here, really. First, I need to get projects to a point where I can actually put them out there. But second, I need to start writing about my development.
