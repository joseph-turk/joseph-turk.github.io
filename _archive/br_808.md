I develop for the web, and I make music, so why not do something to combine the two? This is my take on creating a browser-based drum machine. It features classic TR-808 samples, and right now features an MPC-style pad-based interface. Eventually, I plan to add an 808-style step sequencer.

The app is built using vanilla (ES6) JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
