Doubles as a Frisbee (DAF) is the name of my musical project with a graphic designer friend. I love writing and playing music, but I don't take it too seriously, so DAF gives me an outlet for random ideas.

I wrote a custom WordPress theme for the DAF website to make it easy for either one of us to update without diving in to the code. When we release a new album, we just have to add a new page with the track list, the cover art, and a download link on Amazon S3.
