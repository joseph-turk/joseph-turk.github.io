## Setting the stage

I might be the ideal customer for Dish's new Sling TV service. I'm in my mid-20s and haven't had cable TV since I was splitting the cost with three roommates in college. Since that time, I've been a loyal streaming video consumer. I paid for Hulu Plus for a while, I've had Netflix for what seems like forever, and in the last year I've added Amazon Prime.

Additionally, the biggest reasons I want live TV are sports, cooking shows, and travel shows. So having ESPN, Food Network, and Travel Channel makes Sling TV compelling right off the bat.

## The test

The best thing I think Dish is doing with Sling is offering a free trial. The free trial is what got me hooked on Netflix.

## The problems

But the issue comes from two areas:

* Reliability
* Cost

### Reliability

The service cut out several times. One night, we just went back to Netflix because we couldn't get any channels to stay connected.

### Cost

This is the one that really gets me. Sling is priced mostly against a traditional cable subscription rather than against Netflix.
