I've been playing around with native development lately, running through some intro courses about both iOS and Android development. Swift Playgrounds have won me over on Apple's platform.

Native development has always felt to me so much less immediate than making things for the web. With a website or app, you can be up and running and see things in the browser right away. And if you set up your build process right, you can even have things auto-refresh as you make changes. It provides instant gratification.

On the other hand, native development feels abstract. You need to build and compile your code before you can see anything.

Swift Playgrounds changes that. I can write native code that gets executed immediately, so I can play around with ideas or try out new things.
