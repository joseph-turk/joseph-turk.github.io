    What I'm choosing and why the MacBooks just don't make sense. -->

I like Apple's computers. I'm an Apple fan. But they're making it impossible for me to justify buying a laptop from them.

*Disclaimer: This post is a long and somewhat rambling discussion of the thought process I followed when I recently bought a new laptop. My use cases for a laptop might not (probably don't) exactly match yours. So you might come to a different conclusion.*

I came somewhat late to the Apple party. In high school, I bought a Creative Nomad MP3 player rather than an iPod; when I went off to college, I bought a Dell laptop rather than a MacBook. But in 2010 I bought an iPod Touch, and I was hooked. I went on to buy an iPad 2 shortly after it was released in 2011, and I then bought an iMac later that year. My current phone is an iPhone, and I recently convinced both my parents and my in-laws to switch to iPhones from Android phones.

These days, I consider myself to be solidly in Apple's target laptop demographic. I'm a tech enthusiast. I do some web development, mostly as a hobby, but in a limited capacity in my day job as well. I write and record music. I'm no designer or visual artist, but I still exist very much in Apple's target "creators" niche.

Plus, I'm a millennial. And I have a moderate amount of disposable income. So why am I not buying a new MacBook Pro?


## My System Requirements
My requirements are mostly based around what I need and prefer for web development. I'll also be using this laptop as my main computing device, but aside from development most of my use cases are basic: browsing the internet, writing in a simple text editor, checking email, etc.

My absolute minimum requirements are the following:

- 128 GB of solid state storage
- 8 GB of RAM
- A good keyboard
- A decent trackpad
- An ultrabook-class (ULV) CPU
- 12-15" screen

An ideal system would meet the following requirements:

- 256 GB (or more) of solid state storage
- 16 GB (or more) of RAM
- A backlit keyboard with good key travel
- A good trackpad with multitouch gesture support
- A full-powered mobile CPU
- A high-DPI 12-14" screen (Apple would call it Retina)


## Comparing New Computers
Based on my requirements and my personal brand preferences (not a big HP fan, for instance), I evaluated the following laptops:

- Apple MacBook Pro 15
- Apple MacBook Pro 13 (Without Touch Bar)
- Dell XPS 13
- Lenovo ThinkPad P50
- Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon

### Apple MacBook Pro 15

| Requirement | Specs                      | Rating            |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Storage     | 256 GB PCIe-based storage  | Very Good         |
| RAM         | 16 GB DDR3                 | Very Good         |
| Keyboard    | Backlit, butterfly switch  | Decent            |
| Trackpad    | Massive, multitouch        | Best in Class     |
| CPU         | Quad-core i7, 45W TDP      | Very Good         |
| Screen      | 15.4" 2880x1800            | Very Good         |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
|             |                            | **Price:** $2,399 |

The only thing I would rate lower than Very Good on the MacBook Pro 15 is the keyboard. I've tried it out in the Apple store for a bit, and the second generation butterfly switch is an enormous improvement over the first generation switch found on the Retina MacBook. But it's still not great.

### Apple MacBook Pro 13 (Without Touch Bar)

| Requirement | Specs                      | Rating            |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Storage     | 256 GB PCIe-based storage  | Very Good         |
| RAM         | 8 GB DDR3                  | Good              |
| Keyboard    | Backlit, butterfly switch  | Decent            |
| Trackpad    | Massive, multitouch        | Best in Class     |
| CPU         | Dual-core i5, 15W TDP      | Decent            |
| Screen      | 13.3" 2560x1600            | Very Good         |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
|             |                            | **Price:** $1,499 |

For the MacBook Pro 13, I primarily compared the non-touch bar model. I'm sure at some point developers will do cool things with the bar, but it's not a priority for me right now. I'm not dinging the MacBook Pro 13 on its lack of ports -- I would ideally like more than two Thunderbolt 3 ports, but I could easily make do.

### Dell XPS 13

| Requirement | Specs                        | Rating            |
|-------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Storage     | 128 GB SATA-based storage    | Decent            |
| RAM         | 8 GB DDR3                    | Good              |
| Keyboard    | Backlit                      | Good              |
| Trackpad    | Microsoft Precision Trackpad | Good              |
| CPU         | Dual-core i5, 15W TDP        | Decent            |
| Screen      | 13.3" 1920x1080              | Good              |
|-------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
|             |                              | **Price:** $999   |

The XPS 13 is available with upgrades to address some of the areas I marked it down in. I could have compared a version with PCIe-based storage or a 3200x1800 display. In this configuration, however, I think it represents a good value. Also, though I didn't note it here, the 1080p screen version of the XPS 13 supposedly gets some pretty incredible battery life.

### Lenovo ThinkPad P50

| Requirement | Specs                            | Rating            |
|-------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Storage     | 256 GB PCIe-based storage        | Very Good         |
| RAM         | 64 GB DDR4                       | Best in Class     |
| Keyboard    | Backlit                          | Best in Class     |
| Trackpad    | Multitouch, with TrackPoint      | Very Good         |
| CPU         | Quad-core Xeon E3-1505M, 45W TDP | Best in Class     |
| Screen      | 15.6" 1920x1080                  | Good              |
|-------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
|             |                                  | **Price:** $2,299 |

In contrast to my approach with the XPS 13, I went overkill on the P50. I purposefully specced it out to compete with the MacBook Pro 15 on price, rather than on specs. And for $100 less than the MacBook Pro, I can match the storage, *quadruple* the RAM, and bump up to a true workstation-class processor. Sure, the P50 isn't a thin and light machine. But from a pure performance perspective, this one is hard to beat. Plus, ThinkPad keyboards are incredible.

### Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon

| Requirement | Specs                       | Rating            |
|-------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| Storage     | 128 GB SATA-based storage   | Decent            |
| RAM         | 8 GB DDR3                   | Good              |
| Keyboard    | Backlit                     | Very Good         |
| Trackpad    | Multitouch, with TrackPoint | Very Good         |
| CPU         | Dual-core i5, 15W TDP       | Decent            |
| Screen      | 14" 2560x1440               | Very Good         |
|-------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
|             |                             | **Price:** $1,215 |

The X1 Carbon provides some of the benefits of the P50, such as a solid ThinkPad keyboard, but in a package that's closer to the XPS 13 or MacBook Pro 13. The only real upgrade I selected was the high-res screen option because Lenovo keeps it priced reasonably ($70 extra).

### New Computers Wrap-Up
In comparing these five laptops, two jump out as the best choices, depending on priorities:

- The ThinkPad P50 is an absolute monster and would be my first choice if pure power was my top priority.
- The XPS 13 is an excellent value that checks off at least the bare minimum of each of my requirements while staying under $1,000.


## Comparing Used Computers
Based on my requirements and my personal brand preferences (not a big HP fan, for instance), I evaluated the following laptops:

- Apple MacBook Pro 13
- Apple MacBook Air 13
- Dell XPS 13
- Lenovo ThinkPad X240
