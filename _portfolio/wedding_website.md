I'm getting married in October, and I just couldn't bring myself to use a standard wedding website service. So I decided to have some fun with it.

The site is static HTML built using Foundation. Since the wedding party is spread out over multiple states, I used the Google Maps API to plot them on a stylized map with a short description.
