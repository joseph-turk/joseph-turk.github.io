**Note:** This website is no longer online.

I got married in October of 2015, and I just couldn't bring myself to use a standard wedding website service. So I decided to have some fun with it.

I built the site in static HTML using Foundation. Since the wedding party was spread out over multiple states, I used the Google Maps API to plot them on a stylized map with a short description.
